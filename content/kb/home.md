In 2023, my wife and I purchased our forever home in central New Jersey.

We live on 1.1-acres of land with enough space to do all the things we always wanted to do such as learning to grow sustainable food, raising chickens, and other hobbies that root us to nature.

We are not true homesteaders. We acknowledge that we are very fortunate to live where we do and get to pursue our hobbies as just that, hobbies.
