Overseer is a modular, offline-first Game Master workspace designed to unify core session tools - notes, audio, NPCs, dice, and trackers - into a single screen. Unlike VTTs, it focuses purely on the Game Master experience and avoids combat maps or player-side features.

Overseer allows a Game Master to combine tools together (such as VTTs, soundboards, dice rollers, etc) into a single workspace that streamlines the session experience.

Overseer deliberately avoids becoming a VTT or full campaign manager. It provides clarity and focus by giving GMs exactly what they need during live sessions - nothing more. It works well alongside other tools, or as a total replacement for non-combat games. Its value is simplicity, speed, and purpose-built utility.
