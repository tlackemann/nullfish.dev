## Future Plans

I would love to begin tracking the humidity and temperature of the growing room. I don't think tweaking these will affect growing too much but it would be a neat data point to have. Additionally, I'm interested in creating a small application (see Bootstrapping) to make my spreadsheet a bit easier to manage.
