After 12 days, I harvested just over 1lb of food! I used kitchen shears to cut as close to the base as possible and weighed each tray's clippings on a scale that measured to ounces the thousandth.

Overall, this was fun and I plan to do another set of trays this weekend. The feedback cycle is quick and rewarding and the cost-to-entry was extremely low.

See spreadsheet below for details on the first grow. Enjoy some (limited) pictures of the first grow!
