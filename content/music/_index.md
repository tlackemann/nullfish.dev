A few years back I got really into modular synthesizers. I still am very much interested in the subject but I have had far less time to experiment recently.

You can listen to some of my modular recordings on YouTube as [Learning Machines](https://nullfish.dev/music/learning-machines.html) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/learning-machines).
